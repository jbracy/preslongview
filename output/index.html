                          <img src="/images/housephoto.gif" width="188" height="228" alt="Photo of Judge Campbell House" />The Judge Campbell home was built in 1872, one year after the city of Longview was incorporated.  Longview was the hub of East Texas due to the junction of the East/West trains and the North/South trains.  <p>

Judge J.N. Campbell lived in this house and entertained distinguished guests of the Judiciary and Clergy.  Judge Campbell's brother, Governor Thomas M. Campbell, stayed in the house on his visits, and built his  house in close proximity, which has since been destroyed.

                      <p>
                          In 1965, the Judge Campbell home was recorded as a Texas Historic Landmark; also eligible to be placed on the National Historic Register.  Unfortunately, this Victorian home fell into disrepair and was slated for demolition.  
<p>
Preservation Longview's first project will be to restore this architecturally significant home as the centerpiece of Longview's historic South Main Neighborhood.
                      </p>
<p>
In February 2009, the Judge J.N. Campbell House was placed on the 2009 Texas' Most Endangered List by Preservation Texas.
