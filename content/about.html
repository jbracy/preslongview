                <h1>About us</h1>

<p>Preservation Longview was formed to preserve significant historical sites  and revitalize neighborhoods in Longview. The first site to restore is the Judge James Nathaniel Campbell home due to its age and significance to the city of Longview and State of Texas.</p>

<p>Preservation Longview will be a reference and mentoring group for individuals or organizations in the restoration of other historical properties and neighborhoods.</p>

<p>Preservation Longview is the recipient of three grants from the National Historic Trust and a HOT Grant from the City of Longview.</p>

<p>Construction is underway. Watch the house and this website for progress.  All inquires for construction go to the Project Manager, Kerry Martin at 903-918-4641.</p>
