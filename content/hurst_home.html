<h2>Hurst Home</h2>
<p>1210 Judson Road</p>

<p>
Date of construction:  1932<br />
Architectural Style:  Colonial Revival<br />
</p>

<p>
Built by Dr. V. R. Hurst, a nationally recognized eye, ear, nose and throat physician, the 2-story home was located on the highest site of a farm that extended from near Delwood to Hillcrest.  The roads from downtown were unpaved, and the advent of cars made a move “to the country” possible for professional people.
</p>

<p>
Because the home was being built during the depression, many craftsmen were out of work. Dr. Hurst purposely engaged the finest workmen to build his house and brought in Kermin, a noted decorator from Houston, to oversee the interior. 
</p>

<p>
 Of note is an intricately carved staircase railing.  The walls are made of plaster and the roof is slate, both known for beauty and longevity.  The light fixtures were all custom-made by Abbott in Dallas. 
</p>

<p>
The house has four bedrooms, three and a half baths, formal living, dining room, breakfast room, morning room, butler’s pantry, kitchen, and solarium.
</p>

<p>
The landscaping was done by Lamberts of Shreveport and included a slate goldfish pond under crape myrtles.
</p>

<p>
Today the home is owned by Jacquelyn Jameson, daughter of Dr. Hurst.
