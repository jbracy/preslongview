Thomas Mitchell Campbell, a native of Rusk, Texas, moved to Longview about 1874 to work in the Gregg County Clerk’s office and study law at night.  Earlier he studied law at Trinity University, but a lack of finances led him to withdraw after only a year.  He was admitted to the state bar and began practicing law in Longview in 1878.  In the same year, he married Fannie Irene Bruner of Shreveport.

<p>
Their first home, the “Honeymoon Home,” was a small frame cottage, now located on Second Street, and it is a recorded Texas landmark (1965).  
</p>

<p>
The family later built the elegant Victorian Eastlake home on Methvin Street, and their five children were born there.

<p>
Upon the urging of his old friend, Governor James Hogg, publisher of Longview’s first newspaper, he ran for governor and was elected to two terms, 1907-1911.  The second native Texan to become governor of Texas, he was noted for regulation of utilities, restrictions on lobbying, a pure food law, an insurance law, strength-ening antitrust laws and helping reform prison system.

Later appointed to a receivership position with the International and Great Northern Railroad, he moved to Palestine where he became the railroad’s general manager and kept a private law practice until his death in 1923.

The home was demolished in 1949 and is the current site of the Bramlette Building
