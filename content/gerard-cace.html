    Gerard touched all of Longview in one way or another. He served on many
    boards; he catered our parties; he gave generously of his time; he greeted
    us at Johnny Cace's, and in the past three years at the Historic Longview
    Farmers Market.
</p>

<p>
    Gerard touched people beyond Longview as well. As many local citizens have
    experienced,  visitors to our city often remember Longview because of their
    experience at Johnny Cace's, a landmark with over 60 years of tradition in our
    community.

    There are two ways for you to participate in this memorial:
    
    <ul style="margin-left:20px">
        <li>
            You can contribute to a Texas Historical Marker for Johnny Cace's
            Restaurant. The estimated 2012 price for a marker is $2000.
        </li>

        <li style="margin-top:10px">
            Another opportunity is have a tree planted from you or your
            organization. There will be 12 crepe myrtle trees planted in front
            of the restaurant with plaques acknowledging the donors of each tree.
            Each tree is a donation of $200.
        </li>
    </ul>
